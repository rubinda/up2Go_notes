# What About VS Code?

WebStorm is nice if you have to debug Apex tests, or look through Debug logs, as IlluminatedCloud provides ease of use when fetching and filtering the logs with WebStorm. However! VS Code is amazing and it also works good with SF development. It is in active use throughout the company and I use it too, altough I prefer WebStorm + IC2 for debugging Apex. 

Checkout [VS Code with Salesforce on Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quickstart-vscode-salesforce/) to start using it.
