# What About VS Code?

WebStorm is nice because the Intellisense suggests you everything - it is broken sometimes, but mostly it works great. However! VS Code is amazing and it also works good with SF development - replaying an Apex debug log is nice and great to find issues. It is in active use throughout the company and I use it too for fixing small issues and I prefer WebStorm + IC2 for implementing bigger features.

The guys working on fiber (and now share) also have setup a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). More information on how to use it is available in our [share repository](https://github.com/Up2Go/shaRe-SF).
