# Clean repository

It contains custom implementations that are meant to be used in other repositories. Hence it is present elsewhere as a git submodule. 

## Trick to contribute

For proper development, you'd create a new branch on "clean", push your changes there and then change the branch on 2Team or cprm to your development one and pull changes.

For small tasks, you can just open 2Team or cprm and implement your changes directly in the submodules folder. After you are sure it works, copy it over to your branch on "clean" and commit.
